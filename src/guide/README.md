# Overview

Data is the language of cities. This data is inherently spatial, and as designers and planners we are uniquely suited to leverage it for informed decision making, and the improvement of buildings, public spaces, and cities. Accordingly, this course introduces students to computational design through a unique data-driven workflow for design and analysis using rhino and grasshopper. 

Students will work with and generate geo-spatial data at multiple scales: city, neighborhood and buildings. They will integrate urban data exploration, environmental performance, and derive their own data within a computational design workflow.

The techniques introduced in this course are applicable at both architectural and urban scales; at its core this class is about creating tools to measure performance, drawing with data, and visualization for decision making. The projects will focus on the urban scale: from designing new spatial metrics, to data visualization, to developing performative zoning/policy, to deploying data-driven building types across the city. Projects must be spatial, speculative, iteratively tested and quantitatively evaluated.

This course will be structured as a flipped classroom. With a few exceptions, technical content will be taught through video tutorials done outside of class. Class time will be for reviewing work, reading discussions, in class workshops and conceptual framing of the workflows and techniques. Help sessions will be provided out of class to help with the technical content as needed.

Students must know some Rhino (or do tutorials 1-3 & 6-7 of the [Drawing & Modeling in Rhino Skills Trail](https://skilltrails.gsapp.org/#/map/trail/recwGnruowadxfpVX/drawing--modeling-in-rhino/) prior to the course.) Grasshopper proficiency is not required, but a basic understanding will help. If you are new to grasshopper, it would be helpful to do [Intro to Grasshopper and Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUzYpMlHGw&feature=youtu.be) Trees prior to the first class.   

This year we will introduce students to [Scout](https://scout.build/), an interactive 3D web platform for visual exploration of design + data. We will export our computational design spaces from Grasshopper and load into Scout for analysis and presentations.

Grading be 30% attendance + class participation, 40% weekly assignments, and 30% for the final project.

This is a document that is written in markdown. It is a 'markup language' that allows you to format plain text in a way that is easily converted to many different formats. For example, this document was written in markdown but will be used as an webpage and converted into HTML.  

To present and turn in your final projects for XIM using markdown. You will include all of the text along with any images that you produce.  

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

## Please use level 2 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are as follow:
1. they can be ordered
2. like this
3. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

// do not use spaces in filenames, has a high chance of being misinterpreted by the browser engine

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](https://github.com/).

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:
