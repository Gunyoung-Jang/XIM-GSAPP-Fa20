## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Project Overview

<br />

![Daring question diagram](https://github.com/Gunyoung-Jang/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/blob/main/src/images/Universal%20NYC_Super%20Podium.JPG)


***Super podium*** will enable people to enjoy enough accessibility regardless of different abilities. At the same time, towers on super podium will get bonus FAR for incentive, which richens building design. For this thesis, two building types will be explored, tower+podium and markethall.


Daring question:

```
“What if multiple buildings share one super podium and street nodes are open to enable people easily access upper ?”
```



       

### Goals and Metrics

These section should be descriptive of how your team is setting up goals and metrics to determine success.

1. Goal :
Equality in terms of accessibility, visibility, and safety in NYC / supporting community center

2. What we are mesuring : 
-The number of public spaces(park + node) which are not further than ‘x minute distance’ from the cores of the podium
- X% of the cores have at least three public spaces within ‘x minute distance.’ 

- The percentage of the visible area in view ranges(30ft) at every intersection of roads
- Average view range percentage at every corner

- Average daylight hours of month when heating is required for buildings and roads

- CPTED(Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) Analysis
- The number of the views from the surrounding buildings at every node / average of views in the whole area
- The gap between the highest exposed area and the least exposed area  

3. Why we are masuring it:
Inequality caused by social structure needs to be alleviated, especially nowadays




### What Did We Discover?

```
“We have classified types of disabilities.”
```
 
![type classification](https://github.com/Gunyoung-Jang/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/blob/main/src/images/Universal%20NYC_Disability%20Background%20Research%20(1).jpg)

```
“We analized which metrics can cover which type of disability.”
```

```
“Through the research of the disability in NYC, we have identified susceptible area to 'automation' which can indicate less previlaged area in our point of view.”
```

Analysis in terms of income and pupulation

Analysis in terms of occupation and education

Extracted susceptible area in each category

Found overlapped area and chose this area for our site

![Site perspective coloring](https://github.com/Gunyoung-Jang/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/blob/main/src/images/Universal%20NYC_Site%20Perspective%20coloring.JPG)


## Location and program

The site represents socially alienated place but at the same time, which has great accessibility to lower manhattan in NYC.<br>
New community on this site will support socially neglected people in NYC as public institutes and social housings.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Computational Design Model

<br />

![description](../images/PT_CompDesignModelDiagram.png)
This image should be an ***computational design model diagram*** that clearly describes the relationship between your ***inputs, procedural rules and metrics***. Make a clear, easily read diagram.
*Please include a short caption.*


### Analysis Tools
![description](../images/PT_SummaryAnalysisTool.png)
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*

![description](../images/PT_AnalysisToolSummary.png)
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*

Describe how you are deriving your metric.

1. Have a summary image with each analysis tool (examples above)
1. Use a image / diagram for each custom tool that requires further explanation on how it works. (Example below.)

#### Custom Tool Name
![description](../images/PT_ExampleToolExplanation.png)
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*

[Link](https://github.com/XIM-GSAPP/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/tree/main/src/tools) to any packaged analysis tools you have documented and posted.



### Procedural Types

This section focuses on the rules you have defined, range of variability and an explanation of how they relate to you goals and metrics. 

[Link](https://github.com/XIM-GSAPP/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/tree/main/src/types) to any procedural types you have documented and posted.

![description](../images/PT_DiagramProceduralType.png)
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*

![description](../images/PT_DiagramProceduralTypeSketch.png)
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*

It is encouraged to use sketching when illustrating rules and types of your computational design model.
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*


### Design Space

This section should be descriptive of your team's input ranges, the reasoning why you picked that range and explanation of what you left out. 

```
For example,
"I’m varying this input in this range because of X."
```

Please include simple diagram(s) that illustrate extremes of the design space, animated gif of design space and computational model table. The diagrams and animations should be CLEAR and SIMPLE. These can be animations showing how your model changes one variable at a time, still images explaining the variables, or other drawing types, but you must break down the complexity of your project into intelligible pieces.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Analysis and Results

<br />

### Exploring the Design Space

This section should be descriptive of your team's design exploration and initial insights using Scout. 

***Each team will be conducting a live demonstration of your model in Scout when presenting final project.***

Additionally, teams will be required to document their live demo on GitHub with annotated, sequential screenshots replicating the sequence of the live demonstration. Show how you can use Scout to explore scenarios or answer specific questions using the parallel coordinates chart.

```
For example,
“What if’s . . .”
```

### Results

Were certain metrics inconclusive? Were there unexpected correlations? What are the GENERAL trends in your data? What are your SPECIFIC insights/findings? You can annotate right on top of Scout screenshots or translate insights to diagrams. How does performance (metrics) relate to form (inputs)?

![description](../images/PT_PerformanceSummarySlide.png)
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*

### Design Comparison

Create an image comparing several options that are representative of the trends in your analysis. This should include high and low-performing options, options that perform well in some metrics but poorly in others, options that do a good job of balancing trade-offs, etc. Include text explaining the comparison image and key take-aways. Include an option that gives context to the performance as a baseline or a benchmark. For example, it could be the existing context or an option with your target density but with traditional development patterns (i.e., densification without design innovation.)

Make sure to include both images and the data. Provide a visual hierarchy so that we can see which data are most relevant, which are high vs.  low. These can be simple charts, or even just text. Focus on clearly communicating the data. 

Zoom in to talk about the best option(s) and the worst. Take a few images to detail why these options perform well or poorly. The point of this entire exercise is to create a data-driven methodology for making DECISIONS, so choose which option or options are the best and defend those choices.

### Conclusions and Next Steps

For the concluding text of your computational design model documentation, think about the following questions as you reinforce the reason why the results your team's model should implemented.

1. How do you recommend the results of your model be used? Who should learn from this?
1. If we are treating this as a proof-of-concept to illustrate the viability of this type of computational approach to the city, what are the next steps for implementation?
1. Your project evaluation relative to the anti-bias rubric we developed. These include identifying limitations, what this does and does not do or include.
2. Refering to the outcome of 'X minute public spaces' analysis, design more public spaces not only near buildings but also in the buildings


### Overall format and flow of text:

For each of the sections, write the minimum amount that is necessary for your project to be understood by someone reading your post. Each section needs to stand alone but it should not be text heavy. Someone should be able to read through your post in 10 - 15 minutes.
